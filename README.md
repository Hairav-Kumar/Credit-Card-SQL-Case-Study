# Credit-Card-SQL-Case-Study
Project Overview
Analyzed a credit card transactions dataset to solve real business-driven analytical questions using SQL.

Key Business Problems Solved:

Identified top 5 cities by total credit card spend and their % contribution

Found highest spending month for each card type

Tracked cumulative spend milestones using window functions

Analyzed Gold card spending efficiency across cities

Determined highest & lowest expense types per city

Calculated female spending contribution by expense type

Measured month-over-month growth (Jan 2014) using LAG()

Evaluated weekend spend efficiency by city

Identified the fastest city to reach 500 transactions

--SQL Concepts Used:

CTEs

Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, ROW_NUMBER)

Aggregations & Date Functions

Business logic–driven querying

--This project helped me strengthen my analytical thinking and real-world SQL problem-solving skills.
